Skype for Business Server Visio Stencil by Randy Chapman
========================================================

            

Following the release of the [Skype for Business Protocol Workloads Poster](http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/A/5/EA55692F-47FA-4F49-B17D-259ACAFE95E1/Skype_for_Business_2015_Protocol_Workloads.pdf) and in the absense of official Skype for Business Server Stencils I was inspired to create my own.  The Symnbols are as close to those in the Protocol Workloads Poster as I could make them.


The latest Official Stensils for Office are [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35772).


This is version 1.  As I find more time and more inspiration I might add some stuff.  I expect the official stencils for Skype for Business Server will be made available any day now.  But for now Enjoy.
